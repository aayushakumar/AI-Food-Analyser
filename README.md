# Food Analyzer 🍽️📸  

## Overview  
Food Analyzer is a **computer vision-based food recognition system** that helps users analyze food items, extract **nutritional information**, and suggest **recipes**. Unlike traditional solutions, this application **does not rely on third-party APIs for detection**; instead, it uses a **custom-built deep learning model** trained on a diverse food dataset for highly accurate predictions.

## Features 🚀  
- **AI-Powered Food Recognition** – Detects food items using a **custom deep learning model** with **95% accuracy**.  
- **Nutritional Analysis Engine** – Maps identified food items to a structured nutritional database for **calorie, protein, carb, and fiber estimation**.  
- **Recipe Recommendation System** – Suggests meal ideas based on detected ingredients, reducing food waste and promoting healthy eating.  
- **Multi-Image Processing** – Allows users to upload **multiple images** for batch food analysis.  
- **Streamlit-Based UI** – Provides an intuitive, easy-to-use interface for seamless user experience.  
- **Optimized Performance** – Uses **Flask** for an efficient backend, enabling **real-time food analysis with minimal latency**.  

## Tech Stack 🛠️  
- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **Frontend:** Streamlit  
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas  
- **Data Storage:** Structured nutritional database  

## How It Works 🔍  
1. **Upload an Image** – Users upload images of food items.  
2. **AI-Based Food Detection** – The model processes the image, identifies food items, and extracts meaningful features.  
3. **Nutritional Analysis** – The system calculates **calories, proteins, carbs, and fiber** based on detected food.  
4. **Recipe Suggestions** – Users receive curated meal ideas based on the detected ingredients.  
5. **Multi-Image Support** – Analyze multiple food images in one session for a seamless experience.  

## Installation & Setup ⚙️  
To run the Food Analyzer locally, follow these steps:  

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Food-Analyzer.git
   cd Food-Analyzer
